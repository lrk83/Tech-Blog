# Tech-Blog

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site for tech writers to publish their thoughts and opinions. The site allows visitors to view existing blog posts, or log in to make their own posts and comment on others'. 

When a visitor first reaches the homepage, they are presented with any posts that have already been published, and links to the dashboard, the login page, and the homepage. When the visitor clicks on any links but the homepage, they are taken to the login page where they can create an account or login. 

Once they've logged in they may navigate to the homepage, the dashboard, or click the link to logout. On the homepage, they can click any of the preexisting posts - this takes them to a page which displays the post's text and any comments. A logged in visitor can write a new comment. On the dashboard a visitor can create a new post, or update or delete any of their old posts. If a logged in visitor is idle for too long they are logged out.
